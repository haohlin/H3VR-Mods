# 1.2.0 - Civil Revolt
We will not be forgotten! Biggest update is filling out the Civilian (Rem-meats) weapons with new additions. A bit more early weapon variety to our meaty diet!

Otherwise, primarily a graphic and shop update. Lowered some prices, removed some high-end gear (not weapons though) so they are only gained from drops. Updated a lot of the icons to get a better distinction between similar categories. 

Also redid the ammo box categories to go by power/type rather than faction, which should make it easier to get the ammunition you are wanting. No more needing 7.62x54mmR for your mosin and getting Tokarev!
